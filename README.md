# react-native-stallion
Stallion is the ultimate testing framework for React Native apps !
It is a simplified build sharing and testing system that skips all the tedious hastle of generating a new new APK or IPA build everytime you make react native code changes.
With stallion a developer can directly publish a react native build to Stallion servers and any tester can simply download updates through the Stallion app SDK without re installing the app.
